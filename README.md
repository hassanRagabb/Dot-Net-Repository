## âœ… What I Learned
# 

### ðŸ”Œ LINQ and Entity Framework  Core Practice 

- How to connect to a SQL Server database using EF Core
- Used **DbContext** and **DbSet<T>** to manage data
- How to define models with foreign keys and navigation properties and load related entities using `.Include()` (eager loading)
- How to write LINQ queries for filtering, ordering, and joining
- Applied **code-first** migrations to create tables

#  MVC 
- **Model-View-Controller** architecture
- Separation of logic:
  - **Models**: Define the data structure (e.g., Flight, Reservation, User) and the business logic to do end points operations fpr these classes  
  - **Controllers**: Handle HTTP requests and pass data to views
  - **Views**: Razor files that display data and forms
 
 # ASP.NET WebAPI Fundamentals
 - How to use [HttpGet], [HttpPost], [HttpPut], and [HttpDelete] to handle different HTTP methods
 - Model Binding & DTOs
 - Used Postman & Swagger UI to test endpoints easily

ðŸ“Œ Summary
This practice helped me understand how to build real backend services, connect to a database, and expose clean, testable, and secure APIs using ASP.NET Core and Entity Framework.
